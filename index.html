      <h1>Kai's Adventure: The Storm</h1>
      <div id="sketch-container"></div>
      <p>
        In a sunny seaside town, there is a cheerful young surfer named Kai. He loves nothing more than to ride the waves, his curly hair bouncing with the rhythm of the sea. The beach is his playground, with the golden sand warm under his feet and the sun smiling down from the sky. Kai's surfboard, with its bright and friendly sun, is always ready for adventure, gliding smoothly over the welcoming water. Click on the sun! </p>
